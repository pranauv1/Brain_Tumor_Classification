# Brain Tumor Classification
Brain tumor classification using machine learning.

To train this model I've used 2 datasets links:
1 - https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri (This dataset contains 3 types of most common brain tumors "MRI images")
2 - https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection (This dataset contains weather the MRI image containes a tumor ro not)

So once those datasets combined we'll end up getting 5 classes:<br><br>
  Glioma Tumor (gi)<br>
  Meningioma Tumor (me)<br>
  Pituitary Tumor (pi)<br>
  No Tumor (no)[No Tumor detected]<br>
  Yes Tumor (yes)[Yes Tumor detected, but couldn't classify the tumor]<br>
